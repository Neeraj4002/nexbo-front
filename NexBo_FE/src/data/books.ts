        content: "Financial literacy is the foundation of wealth building. In this lesson, we'll explore:\n\n• What is financial literacy and why it matters\n• The difference between assets and liabilities\n• How money works and the concept of money making money\n• Basic financial terms and concepts every investor should know\n\nFinancial literacy is not just about understanding money; it's about developing the mindset to use money effectively. Robert Kiyosaki emphasizes that it's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep that determines your wealth.\n\nOne of the most important concepts in financial literacy is understanding the difference between assets and liabilities. According to Kiyosaki, an asset puts money in your pocket, while a liability takes money out of your pocket.\n\nAssets include:\n• Businesses that don't require your presence\n• Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds\n• Income-generating real estate\n• Notes (IOUs)\n• Royalties from intellectual property\n• Anything else that generates income, appreciates, and has a ready market\n\nLiabilities include:\n• Mortgages\n• Consumer loans\n• Credit card debt\n• Items that depreciate in value\n\nThe rich focus on acquiring assets, while the poor and middle class focus on acquiring liabilities they think are assets."

        title: "The Cash Flow Quadrant",
        content: "The Cash Flow Quadrant is a powerful concept that helps us understand the different ways people earn money. This quadrant represents the four different types of people in the business world:\n\n• E (Employee) - You have a job and work for someone else\n• S (Self-employed) - You own a job and work for yourself\n• B (Business owner) - You own a system and people work for you\n• I (Investor) - Your money works for you\n\nEach quadrant represents a different approach to generating income and requires different skills, attitudes, and technical knowledge.\n\nE - Employees value security and often make decisions based on fear\nS - Self-employed value independence and control\nB - Business owners value systems and networks\nI - Investors value financial freedom and market knowledge\n\nKiyosaki encourages moving from the left side (E, S) to the right side (B, I) of the quadrant to achieve financial freedom. The left side often involves trading time for money, while the right side focuses on building systems that generate money with minimal time input.\n\nThis transition requires developing new skills and adopting a different mindset about money and work."

        title: "Assets vs. Liabilities",
        content: "One of the most revolutionary concepts in Rich Dad Poor Dad is the clear distinction between assets and liabilities.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki defines them simply:\n\n• An asset is something that puts money in your pocket\n• A liability is something that takes money out of your pocket\n\nThis definition differs from traditional accounting definitions but focuses on cash flow, which is the key to financial freedom.\n\nMany people mistakenly believe their house is an asset, when in reality, if it's taking money out of your pocket each month (mortgage, maintenance, taxes, etc.), it's functioning as a liability.\n\nThe path to wealth, according to Kiyosaki, is straightforward:\n1. Focus on buying assets that generate income\n2. Use that income to buy more assets\n3. Keep your expenses low\n4. Minimize liabilities\n\nThe rich build a solid foundation of income-generating assets before splurging on luxuries. They buy luxuries with the income from their assets, not from their labor or by taking on debt.\n\nAs Kiyosaki puts it: \"The rich buy assets first, then buy luxuries from the passive income. The poor and middle class buy liabilities that they think are assets, and luxuries with their own sweat, blood, and children's inheritance.\""
